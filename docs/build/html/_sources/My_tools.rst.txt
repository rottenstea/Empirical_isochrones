Utility tools
=============

This module consists of a set of basic functions aimed at

- ``Utility functions``: Setting correct path variables and pointers to output files for various scripts in the extraction routine.
- ``Plotting functions``: Generating fundamental summary figures for the extracted isochrones in 2D or 3D, as well as interactive html-figures.

Examples for the use of the listed functions can be found in the Getting-Started_ section.
